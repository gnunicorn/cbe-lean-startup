== Doesn't work

* build by specification/thought up requirements
* not adaptive throughout the process
* things change
* F*cked up measures of succes:
  - did it complete on time
  - is it on budget
  - does it work/does it look good?
  - so then: why is no one using it?
 
.Psssst
NOTE: Model is known to **not work** in Software Development since the 70th: never on time, never in budget, never works.
