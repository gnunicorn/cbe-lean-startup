== Background: Lean Startup & Canvas
  * Term first coined by Eric Ries in 2011
  * origin in japanese car manufacturing of the 1980th:
    - customer focussed, everything else is waste
    - measure key indicators for you to know what to change and how to act
  * Idea: scientific approach to development
    - hyperthesis driven approach
    - build to prove/validate one thesis every time
    - because creating a startup isn't rocket science
  * based on the working principles of Agile-Development and Continues integration
  * Canvas as the main approach by link:http://www.ashmaurya.com/2012/02/why-lean-canvas/[Ash Maurya in 2010]

---------------------------------------------------

== Doesn't work

* build by specification/thought up requirements
* not adaptive throughout the process
* things change
* F*cked up measures of success:
  - did it complete on time
  - is it on budget
  - does it work/does it look good?
  - so then: why is no one using it?
 
.Psssst
NOTE: Model is known to **not work** in Software Development since the 70th: never on time, never in budget, never works.

== Agile Development

* Method of link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development[iterative, incremental development]
* in small focussed cycles
* for continues integration
* self organised teams

          \----------/        \----------/
---------------------------------------------------

== Why this?
  * easier to track if things go wrong
  * quicker to change course
  * each iteration cycle focusses on one aspect
  * if that failed, no big harm, just a slight delay
  * figure things out while you, you don't need to know the solution yet
  * Reduced risk of failure (vs. building something huge for a long time)
== Another thing with high risk and uncertainty?

.Startups


[quote, Eric Ries,]
_________________________________________________________
Startups operate under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

== Lean Startup means being agile
 * Lean startup = being agile
 * Goal: apply agile methods to all parts of the business
 * hypothesis driven approach: have an idea and validate it

== Introducing Lean Startup Canvas

  * derived from the Business Model Canvas
  * descriptive one-pager for all major areas of your business idea
  * easily adaptable, allows quick iterations
  * easy and quick way to give any idea a "reality check"

Goal: find the weak-points and hypothesis to test

== Explaining the canvas
  * Left side: Product
  * Right side: Market
  * Bottom: revenue stream
  * Centre: the core of the business

NOTE: Work yourself from the outside in.

== Product

.Problem
Many Products fail because they are not solving any problem. State the main Problem(s) here. _Plus: What are existing fixes for that problem?_

[quote,Charles Kettering]
____
A problem well stated is a problem half-solved.
____

.Solution
So what is the proposed solution for that problem?

.Key Metrics
What are the main metrics to measure whether the solution is solving that problem? How to know whether it is working?

[quote, Noah Kagan]
____
A startup can only focus on only one metric. So you have to decide what that is and ignore everything else
____

== Market

.Customer Segment
Who is your customer? Who do you need to satisfy? _Plus: Who are the early adopters?_

.Channels:
How do you reach those customers? What are the advertising or communications channels to get them to know you?

.Unfair Advantage:
What is it that makes you the most suited, the best equipped to do that?
[quote, Jason Cohen]
____
A true unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought.
____

== Bottom Line

.Cost Structure
  * What are you main costs?
  * What is going to be spend most money on?
  * State a few
  * Give them percentage signs of how much they cost you

.Revenue Stream
  * Who is paying?
  * How much do they pay and what for?
  * How is the payment-cycle?
  * What is the revenue-model most suited for the case and those customers?

== Core

.Unique Value Proposition
One single sentence that states, why you are different and why anyone would care.

.Plus: elevator pitch
Look at the whole model again. Just going through the whole areas again, you are able to create the single 30-second elevator pitch.


== Start now:

== Need ideas?

How about those:

  * Flickr
  * Spotify
  * Google Adwords
  * Instagram 

== What's next? Iterate!

.Approach problems
  * identify the riskies parts
  * create hypothesis about the risks and how to eliminate them

.Test those hypothesis
  * through customer interview
  * marketing tests
  * building prototypes

.Learn
  * from your tests
  * update the canvas(es)

.Start from top
  * and build a little more every time
