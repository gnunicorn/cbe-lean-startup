== The wrong

We have a wrong idea about the goal of ones life. We believe that you wake up one morning during your collage years, totally hangover but you had this epiphany, what to do with your life. The idea that we got hit by a bigger goal and now, we walk out of the door and pursue it. And if you don't got this hit while you were there, well, then you won't ever achieve greatness in your life.

But what if we got it wrong?

== Case studies

Martin Luther King didn't get up on a random morning and delivered the "I have a dream"-speech because an angel told him so in his dream.

Mahatma Gandhi didn't defeat the British Empire because he figured out he had to do that, when he was 15. He actually studied law in London.

Nelson Mandela didn't go to prison because it was all part of a bigger master plan to overthrow the apartheid, he made up when he co-initiated the Youth League.

== No master plan

[quote, John Lennon,]

Because there is no master plan. Life is iterative. And we humans are not able to experience time in a different than the linear way. So life happens to us. We are not in control. Even if we had a master plan, life would always get in the way. There is no way, we can actually execute a master plan fully.


== Waterfall model

In product development, we call this the "Waterfall"-model: You come up with an initial plan and then you execute it, until you are done. But a good plan requires good preparation, so one often gets lost in unimportant nitty-gritty details. Another common problem is, that life gets in the way and by the time we are down the line executing, things have changed and the intial goal doesn't make any sense anymore.

So you either continue headless or you change course. Which means, getting back to the drawing board.

And most of us don't even make it out of the planning phase in the first place. While actually implementing it, would be the harder part.

== vs. the Agile Model

Because that has been proven to be very often the case in software development, Software Developers have created a different model: in *Agile Development* you accept your ignorance and work in iterations. Instead of making up a big master plan, you commit to a more vague idea, vision or mission, you want to accomplish. 

But instead of trying to specify everything and come up with a huge master plan, you work on one part of it at a time in small, short iterations. After each iteration, you come back to your vision, might adapt it and define the next most important step. And then you focus on that step. That way you are much more flexible to change and your plan doesn't fall apart, just because this one thing in it doesn't work.

While you work on it, the mission and your vision because clearer and clearer by the way you are shaping it.

== Back to the case study

If we now look back to the former cases, we realise, they actually worked in an iterative, step-by-step style. They were all from early on dedicated towards their later master plan, but they didn't know it yet. With every decision and step they took, they took them with their vision or a greater idea in the back of their head. But they didn't know, where they would end up with it. 

Or do you believe Martin Luther King planned on being murder. Or Mahatma Gandhi?

Life is what happens, while you make plans. So, don't make plans. 

== The big question

But that doesn't mean you are helpless. If life is going to shape big parts of it, isn't it set to chance for us to achieve greatness? And if we agree on that fact that having the idea/goal is only the smaller part and implementation is what actually makes the difference, how can one ever achieve anything if we don't even know the idea?

== the lean method 

But then what if, instead of trying to find our goal in life and executing towards it, we accept that we can't know it just yet and that actually life is going to define a big part of it.

And with that accepted, we look for topics, which define our life. Broader parts, as we can't see the master plan yet, and start implementing towards them. And not in a big chunk, but one part at a time. Don't try to give up junk food, smoking, drinking and make more sports at the same time. The odds are, you are much more successful if you focus on one at a time.

== Topics

Because there are defining topics in anyones life. Things we always did care about and whatever happens came back to. And if the job didn't allow us to do that, we did it in our spare time. 

Just think back of your childhood. What are your first memories on something you've been passionate about?
