ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: wrong-way]
== We are wrong

[role="handout"]
We have a wrong idea about the *meaning of ones life*. We believe that you wake up one morning during your college years, totally hangover and you had this *epiphany, what to do with your life*. The idea that we got hit by a bigger meaning and now, we walk out of the door and pursue it. And if you don't got this hit while you were there, well, then you won't ever achieve greatness in your life.

[role="handout"]
But what if we got it wrong?

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground!:]
== Case studies


ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: mr-king]
== Martin Luther King

[role="handout"]
didn't get up on a random morning and delivered the "I have a dream"-speech because an angel told him so in his dream.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: gandhi]
== Mahatma Gandhi
[role="handout"]
didn't defeat the British Empire because he figured out he had to do that, when studying law in London.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: mandela]
== Nelson Mandela

[role="handout"]
didn't go to prison because it was all part of a bigger master plan to overthrow the apartheid, he made up when he co-initiated the Youth League.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: lennon]
== No master plan

[quote, John Lennon,]
_________________________________________________________
Life is what happens to you while youâ€™re busy making other plans.
_________________________________________________________

[role="handout"]
Because there is no master plan. Life is iterative. And we humans are not able to experience time in a different than the linear way. So life happens to us. We are not in control. Even if we had a master plan, life would always get in the way. There is no way, we can actually execute a master plan fully.


ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground!:]
== Waterfall model

[role="handout"]
In product development, we call this the "Waterfall"-model: You come up with an initial plan and then you execute it, until you are done. But a good plan requires good preparation, so one often gets lost in unimportant nitty-gritty details. Another common problem is, that life gets in the way and by the time we are down the line executing, things have changed and the intial goal doesn't make any sense anymore.

[role="handout"]
So you either continue headless or you change course. Which means, getting back to the drawing board.

[role="handout"]
And most of us don't even make it out of the planning phase in the first place. While actually implementing it, would be the harder part.

== vs. the Agile Model

[role="handout"]
Because that has been proven to be very often the case in software development, Software Developers have created a different model: in *Agile Development* you accept your ignorance and work in iterations. Instead of making up a big master plan, you commit to a more vague idea, vision or mission, you want to accomplish. 

[role="handout"]
But instead of trying to specify everything and come up with a huge master plan, you work on one part of it at a time in small, short iterations. After each iteration, you come back to your vision, might adapt it and define the next most important step. And then you focus on that step. That way you are much more flexible to change and your plan doesn't fall apart, just because this one thing in it doesn't work.

[role="handout"]
While you work on it, the mission and your vision because clearer and clearer by the way you are shaping it.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: end]
== Back to the case study

[role="handout"]
If we now look back to the former cases, we realise, they actually worked in an iterative, step-by-step style. They were all from early on dedicated towards their later master plan, but they didn't know it yet. With every decision and step they took, they took them with their vision or a greater idea in the back of their head.

 * They didn't know, where they would end up. 
 * Or do you believe Martin Luther King planned on being murder.
 * Or Mahatma Gandhi?

Life is what happens, while you make plans. Ergo, *don't make plans*.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: mercy]
== The big question

But that doesn't mean you are helpless?

[role="handout"]
If life is going to shape big parts of it, isn't it set to chance for us to achieve greatness? And if we agree on that fact that knowing the meaning is only the smaller part and implementation is what actually makes the difference, how can one ever achieve anything if we don't even know the idea?

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: lean]
== The Lean Method 

[role="handout"]
But then what if, instead of trying to find our goal in life and executing towards it, we accept that we can't know it just yet and that actually life is going to define a big part of it.

[role="handout"]
And with that accepted, we look for topics, which define our life. Broader parts, as we can't see the master plan yet, and start implementing towards them. And not in a big chunk, but one part at a time. Don't try to give up junk food, smoking, drinking and make more sports at the same time. The odds are, you are much more successful if you focus on one at a time.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: topics]
== Topics

[role="handout"]
Because there are defining topics in anyones life. Things we always did care about and whatever happens came back to. And if the job didn't allow us to do that, we did it in our spare time. 

[role="handout"]
Just think back of your childhood. What are your first memories on something you've been passionate about? And then think about the actual, broader thing and the specifics that make this something you care about. It isn't shopping for example, but it is hanging out with your peers or the love of beautiful products.

[role="handout"]
Did you notice I changed the tense here? I made this past thing you were passionate about something you care about. And that is the whole point. These main things, we do care about deeply, they don't change that much.

[role="handout"]
Find the main key topics you care about. If you find more than four, they probably overlap. Find that overlap.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: style]
== Life style

[role="handout"]
The another very important thing is the style of life we want to live by. It is impossible for us to achieve much, if we live in conditions that make it hard for us.

[role="handout"]
So think about your life and the style you want to live by. Do you want to live in a huge, busy city or do you enjoy the calmness of smaller villages? Do you need regularity and rules? Or do you prefer to go with the wind?  And how do you approach it, when something isn't fit for your style? Do you freak out, do you need it to be perfect or are you ok with things not being totally clear?

[role="handout"]
This is probably also something you can already see in your earlier childhood. And also think about the influence your parents or other children might had on this because it was unacceptable behaviour. You were happy in the mess you called your bedroom? Then this is the way you are most comfortable to be organised.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: market]
== Trade Offs

[role="handout"]
But this all comes with costs. The topics and especially the way you are and the life style you choose come with certain trade-offs you need to make. For example, if you want an exciting life and travel the world, a trade-off might be stability and security as a small village and family-life would offer you.

[role="handout"]
So think hard about those topics and the admired life-style and what you have to trade-off for that. Write it all down, even if you are not yet comfortable with that. But you should at least be aware of them and later on, can decide whether it is worth the trade-off for you or not.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: people]
== People

[role="handout"]
The other highly important thing in ones life are the people surrounding us. After all the human erectus is a herding animal and we are highly influenced by the people around us. We need other people to support us, we need other people to correct us and to learn from. This can be family or friends, peers or colleagues, volunteer groups or strangers we meet in a bar. But we need them.

[role="handout"]
Think about the kind of people you have, you need and you want in your life. Not only think about people that share your same topics but more over of people, who can and will support you, no matter what. You will need them in tough times.

[role="handout"]
But also think of your roles models. Who are them? Why them? Try to find specific role models and admire them for a specific trade. No ones life was always as dreamy and great at one might think. But that specific part, that how you want to be about certain things.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: hug]
== Relationships

[role="handout"]
As important as the people in our lifes are the relationships we have. The happiness and richness of our life is very dependant on the people and what relationship we have with them. And though every relationship is different, there are patterns in a human life and seeing and learning about them, helps you understand yourself.

[role="handout"]
Some people have one very close and many rather far away friends, others are very family-driven. Others only have male or female friends. Think about what kind of relationships around you make you happy. 

[role="handout"]
And then think about how to make sure these relationships continue to work. For some it is really important to be in touch every day, for other you can have no contact in a decade but when you reach out to them, they got your back and it is as if you never stopped high school.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: luxury]
== Benefits and Luxuries

[role="handout"]
Aside from all of these things, there are thing in life we enjoy the most. Those can be very personal and might not be understood by others ever. It can be an addiction to that one ice cream flavour that is really hard to get or the leather couch, the view on the sea or driving around in a car.

[role="handout"]
Those are things that might even be harmful to us and our body, but we enjoy them non-the-less, which is while some argue you should get rid of them. I'd argue the opposite: keep them. But call them what they are: Luxuries. You don't need them and you can probably stay without them for a good while but don't cut them out of your life.

[role="handout"]
Especially in hard moments they can lighten up your day and make you aware that even the worst day has something good. But they are also precious. Consumed to often luxuries become a commodity and lose their effect. Guard them, keep them in your pocket as something to enjoy once in a while out of good or bad reason. But you deserve luxuries, too. And make sure you give yourself a good treat ones in a while.

ifdef::backend-slidy2[:slidebackground: life]

== This is your life

[role="handout"]
All this together defines your life[role="handout"]. This defines who you are, what you do and what you are aiming towards. And if you look at it, you'll find quite a few things are not as they are supposed to be yet.

[role="handout"]
This is where the iteration model comes in: find those things. Mark them and find the one that you want to work on next time. Come up with a good action plan on how to tackle that specific part. And come up with a good metric on figure out, whether you got closer to it. And once you are close enough, come back to the board, re-arange things to reflect this or other changes and look for the next thing to focus on.

[role="handout"]
You will add and remove things constantly, refine, rephrase and redefine things. And that is ok. The further you get implementing your life, the clearer it will becomes what it is about. So it is totally okay to start out with rather broad topics and get better at it while you go.
